AWS EC2 Instance Types and Pricing Models
=========================================

1. EC2 Instance Families
------------------------

General Purpose:
- Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
- Examples: t4g, t3, t2, m6, m5, m4

Compute Optimized:
- Best for compute-intensive applications.
- Examples: c7, c6, c5, c4

Memory Optimized:
- High memory for in-memory databases, caching.
- Examples: r7, r6, r5, x2, z1d

Storage Optimized:
- High-speed local storage with low latency.
- Examples: i4, i3, d3, h1

Accelerated Computing:
- GPU or FPGA for ML, AI, graphics, and HPC.
- Examples: p5, p4, g5, g4, f1, inf2

Use Case Examples:
- Web server: t3.micro
- Machine learning training: p4d.24xlarge
- Big data analytics: r6i.4xlarge

2. EC2 Pricing Models
---------------------

On-Demand:
- Pay-as-you-go with no long-term commitment.
- Best for short-term and unpredictable workloads.

Reserved Instances:
- Commit to 1 or 3 years for a discounted rate.
- Ideal for long-term stable workloads (e.g., databases).

Savings Plans:
- Flexible discount model by committing usage.
- More flexible than Reserved Instances.

Spot Instances:
- Use spare AWS capacity at up to 90% discount.
- Best for batch jobs, ML training, or interruptible workloads.

Dedicated Hosts:
- Physical server dedicated to you.
- Good for compliance and licensing needs.

Free Tier:
- 750 hours per month for t2.micro or t3.micro free for 12 months.

3. Instance Recommendations by Use Case
---------------------------------------

- Learning / Testing: t2.micro, t3.micro (Free Tier)
- Web App / API Hosting: t3.medium, m5.large
- Databases: r6g.large, r5.large
- Machine Learning Inference: g5.xlarge, inf2.xlarge
- Machine Learning Training: p4d.24xlarge, p5.48xlarge
- Video Rendering / Gaming: g4dn.xlarge, g5.2xlarge
- HPC (High Performance Computing): c6gn, hpc6id, f1
- Data Warehouse Storage: i4i, d3en
